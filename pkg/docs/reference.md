# Reference

Generated from the package by `qa/docs.mjs`; `npm run docs:check` fails when it is stale. Every
text below is the doc an editor shows on hover.

## Limits

`limits`, exported from the package. A builder, a validator and `decodeObject` refuse past each
one with a `ValidationError` whose `code` is `length`, `count` or `size` and whose `limit` is
the value here. A length counts Unicode code points, not UTF-16 units and not bytes.

## Media types

The declared type of a file picks the extension of its path and is never stored. A type is
matched on its essence: the text before any `;`, ASCII-lowercased. Any type not below, an empty
one included, gets `.bin`.

| type | extension |
|---|---|
| `application/javascript` | `.js` |
| `application/json` | `.json` |
| `application/octet-stream` | `.bin` |
| `application/pdf` | `.pdf` |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | `.bin` |
| `application/xml` | `.xml` |
| `application/zip` | `.zip` |
| `audio/mpeg` | `.mp3` |
| `audio/wav` | `.wav` |
| `image/gif` | `.gif` |
| `image/jpeg` | `.jpg` |
| `image/png` | `.png` |
| `image/svg+xml` | `.svg` |
| `image/webp` | `.webp` |
| `multipart/form-data` | `.bin` |
| `text/css` | `.css` |
| `text/csv` | `.csv` |
| `text/html` | `.html` |
| `text/plain` | `.txt` |
| `text/xml` | `.xml` |
| `video/mp4` | `.mp4` |
| `video/mpeg` | `.mpeg` |

## Stored objects

Each object as `decodeObject` gives it and `encodeObject` takes it. Every known member is
present, `null` when it has no value, and `$unknown` carries members a newer writer added, as
text. Integers are numbers; `created_at` is microseconds since the epoch.

### User

A profile, stored at `/pub/social/v1/profile.json`: one per owner, public.

| member | type | null | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `links` | `UserLink[]` | yes | At most 5 links shown on the profile; null for none. |
| `name` | `string` |  | The display name, trimmed by the builder: 3 to 50 code points, not blank. |
| `bio` | `string` | yes | A short description, trimmed by the builder: at most 160 code points; null for none. |
| `image` | `string` | yes | The avatar: a canonical pubky or web URI of at most 300 code points, never under the private root; null for none. |
| `status` | `string` | yes | A status line, trimmed by the builder: at most 50 code points; null for none. |
| `$unknown` (optional) | `string` |  | The members a newer writer added, as the text they were read with. Carry it along. |

| member | type | null | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `"image" \| "note" \| "article" \| "video" \| "link" \| "file" \| "collection"` |  | What the post is, one of `postKinds`: a kind this version does not know is refused on read. It decides what `content` holds. |
| `attachments` | `Attachment[]` |  | At most 10 media references; empty for none. A collection carries none: its items are in its envelope. |

### FeedFilters

The search filters of a resources feed (`FeedConfig.filters`), every value a string and null for not set, in the app's `/search` vocabulary. Every member but `place` is in the feed's id, and a member this version does not know is refused. The README maps each one to Pinakes `GET /v1/search`.

| `sort` | `string` | yes | An order in place of the feed's own `sort`, which stays in the id: `trending`, `upcoming` (by start, soonest first, from now on unless `when`, `from` or `to` set the window) or `nearest` (with `near`). |
| `window` | `string` | yes | The window `trending` counts references in: `24h`, `7d` or `30d`; `7d` without. Only with `sort` `trending`. |
| `rows` | `string` | yes | `links`: every link as a row, where the feed otherwise lists one row per thing. |
| `$unknown` (optional) | `string` |  | Always empty: a read refuses a member this version does not know. |

## Error codes

| `count` | a list has more items than `limit` |
| `blank` | text, a list or a file is empty or whitespace only |

| `id` | an id does not match its object, or its time is out of bounds |
| `reference` | a URI in a reference position is refused |
| `unknown_name` | a kind, reach, layout, sort or target this version does not know, or a member of a resources feed's `filters` this version does not know |
